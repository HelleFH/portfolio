          <p>
            While studying for a master’s degree at DTU (the Danish Technical
            University), I worked extensively with Python and GIS tools. That
            experience deepened my problem-solving mindset and confirmed my
            passion for frontend development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I’m focused on growing as a full-stack developer, learning
            new technologies, and creating digital experiences that are both
            functional and enjoyable to use.
